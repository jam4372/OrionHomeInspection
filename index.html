                        A home inspection is a visual examination of the home's major structure, systems and components that are visible and safely accessible.  The inspector should substantially adhere to a standards of practice that outlines what should be covered during a general home inspection, as well as what is excluded. Some inspectors may strictly follow the standards of practice, while others may exceed the standards and inspect other items, or perform a more detailed inspection. Whatever the inspector includes in his or her inspection should be discussed prior to the inspection – this is known as the scope of work. The inspector should be able to provide you with a copy or online link to the standards of practice they follow.  The inspector should provide you with a written report, which may include photos and/or recommendations, of his or her findings of the inspection.  Read <a href="https://www.nachi.org/sop.htm" target="_blank">InterNACHI's Standards of Practice</a> to find out what is typically included and excluded in a home inspection.

                        Buying a home is typically the biggest investment you will ever make, so it's important to get a home inspection because the inspector should be able to discover and document defects that may or may not be obvious to you as a prospective buyer.  Such defects can range from simple replacements or repairs, to severe damage or safety and health concerns. Additionally, most mortgage companies require a home inspection on a property before approving the home loan.

                        It is important to choose a home inspector who is qualified and holds a license or certification in the field. Many jurisdictions do not regulate home inspections, meaning that anyone could call themselves a home inspector. However, just because someone performs home inspections doesn't mean that they're actually qualified to do so. If you are buying or selling a home in an unregulated jurisdiction, make sure to look for a home inspector with the proper certifications. If you are located in a state or province that does require licensing of home inspectors, you should hire only a licensed professional.<br>
                        <br>Contact your state by phone or online to find out whether they license home inspectors, and what qualifications they're required to have.  License numbers in licensing states may vary in appearance, but you should be able to independently verify it. If your state doesn't require licensing, find out what qualifications and certifications your home inspector has. <a href="https://www.nachi.org/" target="_blank">The International Association of Certified Home Inspectors – InterNACHI®</a> – is the largest and most trusted home inspector association in the world.  Its members undergo rigorous training to become Certified Professional Inspectors (CPIs)®.  They also follow a Standards of Practice and adhere to a Code of Ethics.  Also, the Master Inspector Certification Board grants qualified inspectors the title of <a href="https://certifiedmasterinspector.org/" target="_blank">Certified Master Inspector® (CMI®)</a>, which is the highest professional designation in the inspection industry.  Find out if your inspector is licensed and/or a CPI or CMI® before you hire him or her. This will ensure that you are hiring only an individual who has received the best training to become a home inspector.

                        Depending on the home's age, size, and location, as well as the home inspector's own work protocols and ethic, your home inspection may take three hours or longer. Adding square footage, outbuildings, and/or ancillary services (such as mold or radon testing) will increase that time. It may be necessary for your inspector to bring in a helper for a very large property. If your general home inspection takes significantly less than two to three hours, it may indicate that the inspector was not thorough enough.

                        A home inspection is usually scheduled after an offer has been made and accepted, but before the closing date. That way, the inspector can rule out any major defects that could be dangerous or costly. In rare cases—due to timing or contractual issues—the inspection can be scheduled after the closing date. If this is the case, the home buyer should schedule the inspection for the earliest possible date after closing.

                        What if your home inspector is also a licensed contractor? Sounds great, right? Not always. Although it may seem convenient to have an inspector who is also a contractor, it poses a conflict of interest. According to <a href="https://www.nachi.org/code_of_ethics.htm" target="_blank">InterNACHI's Code of Ethics</a>:
                        <br><br><div style="margin-left: 1em;">"<em>The InterNACHI member shall not perform or offer to perform, for an additional fee, any repairs or associated services to the structure for which the member or member's company has prepared a home inspection report for a period of 12 months. This provision shall not include services to components and/or systems that are not included in the InterNACHI Standards of Practice.</em>"</div><br>
                        If an inspector financially benefits from finding any defects, this can impact the accuracy of the report (whether intentional or not). Make sure the inspector you hire abides by a Code of Ethics and Standards of Practice.

                        If your home inspection reveals any problems, it is important to understand the severity of the defect. For example, a missing shingle or dirty air filter can be easily fixed at a low cost. However, if the defect is more extreme, such as a major foundation crack, wood-destroying organism infestation, or evidence of mold, you should find out how these problems can be addressed, and whether you can negotiate their cost with the seller.

            <p class="lead">Orion Home Inspectors are thorough, and they carefully document all findings in our comprehensive reporting software, which includes dialogue, pictures, and checklists, as well as section overviews and overall report summaries to make sure the important points can be quickly and easily found. We encourage our clients to be with us during inspections so that we can explain our findings on-site. We strive to present our findings in an honest and balanced way in order to give you peace of mind and valuable knowledge about your home. Our goal is to help people understand the home’s condition so that they can make wise and educated decisions about the property.<br>Our inspectors possess the required state and local licensing for inspections, and have training and certifications with premier home inspection organizations, which you can find more about in the About Us section below. Our insurance provider is a home inspection specialist with excellent experience in the industry, and we carry E&O and General Liability insurance to protect both our clients and our inspectors.</p>

            <p class="lead">Our job is to inspect major components of a property for their wear and condition. These components include, but are not limited to, the foundation, plumbing/electrical systems, floors, walls, ceilings, heating/cooling systems (when safe to operate), attic/insulation, roof, windows/doors, and observable structural components. We do not report on things like furnishings, decorum/aesthetics or landscaping, unless something about them poses some threat or danger to the property. We adhere to the ASHI Standards of Practice, which can be viewed <a href="https://www.homeinspector.org/Standards-of-Practice" target="_blank">here</a> for more specific details on what an inspection covers.</p>
